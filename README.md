# ESG-Score-Integration: Ethically Responsible Investment Portfolio Generator

This project focuses on integrating ethically responsible criteria into investment portfolios using proprietary **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)** scores. The repository provides a GUI application that allows users to create an equity investment portfolio based on their ESG preferences, along with comprehensive documentation of the data gathering and ESG score-building processes. 

---

##  Overview  
### Key Features:
- **GUI Application**: An intuitive interface to input ESG criteria and generate a personalized equity investment portfolio.  
- **Custom ESG Scores**: Proprietary ESG scores are built using a systematic methodology for each stock.  
- **Data Integration**: Processes include daily stock price analysis, market capitalization, and the Fama-French 3-Factor model for robust portfolio creation.

##  How It Works  
1. **User Input**  
   Users provide their ESG preferences through an intuitive GUI application.

2. **Algorithm**  
   The application processes:  
   - User preferences  
   - ESG scores  
   - Financial data (e.g., stock prices, market capitalization)  

   It then uses a robust algorithm to generate an optimized investment portfolio.  

3. **Output**  
   A detailed portfolio allocation tailored to the user's ethical and financial goals is displayed.

##  Methodology  
### ESG Scoring:
1. Data is collected from the Bloomberg Terminal for Nasdaq Composite Index members.  
2. Scores for **Environmental (E)**, **Social (S)**, and **Governance (G)** criteria are computed and aggregated into a comprehensive ESG score.  
3. Results are stored in `esg_scores.csv` for integration into the portfolio generation process.

### Portfolio Construction:  
- Utilizes **beta**, **market cap**, and **ESG preferences** to optimize equity allocation.  
- Incorporates the **Fama-French 3-Factor model** for advanced portfolio analytics.

---

##  Future Enhancements  
- Expand ESG score coverage to global stock markets.  
- Add more advanced portfolio optimization techniques.  
- Include real-time data fetching for a live dashboard.
